# 👩‍💻 About Me
I’m a **Senior Technical Writer** with **13 years** of experience delivering clear, impactful content that bridges the gap between complex technology and real-world users. My expertise spans technical documentation, product marketing assets, customer-facing guides, and highly professional business presentations.

I’ve contributed across telecom, fintech, SaaS, banking, healthcare, maritime, and enterprise tech sectors, transforming technical concepts into accessible, user-friendly content that supports product adoption, improves user experience, and aligns with go-to-market strategies.  

From building structured documentation from the ground up or crafting compelling value propositions for product launches, I bring clarity, consistency, and a user-centric approach to every project with a passion for precision and a commitment to quality.
